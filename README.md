I know sometimes donations are quite difficult to talk about and I'm not meaning to make anyone person uncomfortable. Donations really do help me to keep my project running with server fees and just overall commitment to my projects. A donation give me the feedback that someone really must want this project to succeed and they help me to know which projects are a keeper and which are a goner.
